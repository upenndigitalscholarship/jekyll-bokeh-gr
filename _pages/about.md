Goodreads is the world’s leading social reading and curation site. Its 50
million unique users per month rate and review the books they
read, arranging them on personalized “shelves,” and forming fan clubs,
friend networks, and discussion groups.  It is a site of major importance for
literary reception studies, a field that cuts across the disciplines of
sociology, psychology, and literary studies, and involves scrutiny not (merely)
of works of literature but of the tastes and habits and experiences of actual
readers.  Perhaps the greatest challenge for reception scholars has been the
difficulty of gathering datasets adequately representative of such a vast and
varied field of practice as reading.  The typical procedure has been to
generalize from quite small scale studies of at most a few dozen relatively
homogeneous subjects.  The massive quantity of data about all sorts of readers
and reading contained on the Goodreads site is potentially transformative of the
field.

The Mining Goodreads project at Penn, which focuses on readers of contemporary
fiction, has built a database comprising nearly three million Goodreads reviews,
together with corresponding ratings (on a 5-star scale), and metadata on the
books, authors, and users themselves. We have gathered all the reviews of 500
bestsellers and of 1300 novels that made the shortlists of major awards since
1960, plus a substantial cross-section of the reviews of curated top-200 lists
of mystery/crime/detective fiction, science fiction, and chick lit/modern
romance novels.  In addition, we have compiled all the reviews written by a
random set of 1,750 highly active Goodreads users, who between them have read
more than 300,000 unique works of fiction across the full range of popular and
not-so-popular genres. We have refined and structured this data and developed
quite a lot of code, most of which may be shared with other researchers to help
them pursue their own questions about contemporary readers, tastes, and values.

We have not made use of any information pertaining to users who maintain private
accounts or profiles on Goodreads.  Although the information we have collected
is freely visible to any browser, we have designed our experiments and composed
our outputs so as to ensure the anonymity of all users in our sample.  The User
ID numbers that appear in our Bokeh visualizations are randomly assigned for our
own purposes; they are not actual Goodreads IDs.
