This visualization is based on the same way of visualizing the taste profiles of readers as in our Reader Network map.  The only difference is that here we have applied a log transformation to the distances between readers.  On the non-transformed Reader Network map, distance between two readers is the probability of one reader having read a random book from the other reader's review shelf, and vice versa.  In this version, we use the log probability, which tends to make distances on different scales easier to interpret by creating greater spread between unsimilar user-points. 

In other respects, the t-SNE algorithm is identical.  Similarity or difference between two readers' tastes was calculated according to the specific books they have reviewed rather than just the genres of those books. The code generates a distance matrix by treating all the books and all the users as part of a bimodal network -- that is, a network with two kinds of nodes that only connect to nodes of the other type. It then "imagines" a process: suppose you talk to a random user and ask for a recommendation. They randomly pick one of the books they've reviewed. Then you talk to other random users until you find one who has also reviewed that book.  You then ask that reader for a new recommendation ... ad infinitum. By repeating this process a vast number of times the algorithm determines the probability of going from any given user to another given user.  The distance between them on the chart is the log transformation of that probability.   

To make the method work nicely we posit that all users have reviewed one amazingly popular book that we don't know the title of. This ensures that all users are slightly connected in the network, yielding at least some small probability of going from any one to any other. You might say that this imaginary book is goodreads.com.
