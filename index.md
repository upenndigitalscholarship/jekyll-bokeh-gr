This site is part of the project “Mining Goodreads: Literary Reception Studies at Scale.” Our About page gives more information about the project as a whole. On the other pages here we share some of our visualizations of the reading done by 1672 highly active users of Goodreads. They are a random sample of all users who had posted at least 150 reviews to the site as of January 2018.
